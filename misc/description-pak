Adds support for url-like schemes to the glibc's fopen function.

cushions - CUstom Stream Handlers Integrated by Overriding Native Symbols
libcushions aims at adding support for url-like schemes to the glibc's fopen
function. By using linker flags or the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, this can
be done without modifying or even without recompiling the program, adding
transparent support for archives files, or web urls, for example.
