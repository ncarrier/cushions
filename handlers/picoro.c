/*
 * The main loop for a coroutine is responsible for managing the "idle" list.
 *
 * When we start the idle list is empty, so we put ourself on it to
 * ensure it remains non-NULL. Then we immediately suspend ourself
 * waiting for the first function we are to run. (The head of the
 * running list is the coroutine that forked us.) We pass the stack
 * pointer to prevent it from being optimized away. The first time we
 * are called we will return to the fork in the coroutine()
 * constructor function (above); on subsequent calls we will resume
 * the parent coroutine_main(). In both cases the passed value is
 * lost when pass() longjmp()s to the forking setjmp().
 *
 * When we are resumed, the idle list is empty again, so we fork
 * another coroutine. When the child coroutine_main() passes control
 * back to us, we drop into our main loop.
 *
 * We are now head of the running list with a function to call. We
 * immediately yield a pointer to our context object so our creator
 * can identify us. The creator can then resume us at which point we
 * pass the argument to the function to start executing.
 *
 * When the function returns, we move ourself from the running list to
 * the idle list, before passing the result back to the resumer. (This
 * is just like yield() except for adding the coroutine to the idle
 * list.) We can then only be resumed by the coroutine() constructor
 * function which will put us back on the running list and pass us a
 * new function to call.
 *
 * The conversion between the function pointer and a void pointer is not
 * allowed by ANSI C but we do it anyway.
